This repository follows a Udemy course: 
React - The Complete Guide
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

This project was built with create react app, which conveniently handles the frontend pipeline and gives access to a local testing server.

I'll try to keep this updated with any additional dependencies used, although the json files are included here.
